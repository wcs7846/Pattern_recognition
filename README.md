# Pattern_recognition

These programs are writen by using MATLAB

These procedures are based on the "pattern recognition" (Fourth Edition) this book in the practice and the experiment to write, and
I will update the code irregularly.

The codes are saved is two folders:
    Example --to save the code about the example
    Practice--to save the code about the experiment on machine
    Program --to save the code about the programming on machine

Maybe some codes have a little bug, so please tell me and note the position.

In the end, I'm a Chinese ,so If you can speak Chinese, Please use it.---Thanks
